        <p>
            This project was killer! I implemented a basic rasterizer complete with fundamental antialiasing and texture mapping tools. I encountered
            the most bugs while implementing supersampling support but learned the most while working on the texture mapping portion. My supersampling bug
            turned out to be trivial - dividing a sum by the wrong value. The math and high-level ideas involved in texture mapping and mipmaps took me
            longer to digest but were incredibly rewarding to successfully implement. It feels amazing to see an image render correctly after lots of intensive 
            debugging!!!

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
        <p>
            The rasterize_triangle() function takes in three points and a color as its arguments.
            First, I calculate the overall minimum and maximum x and y values of the given points in order to determine the
            dimensions of the bounding box of the triangle. Next, I iterate over all of the pixels in/on the bounding box and check wether or
            not they lie in/on the triangle. This check is performed using three line tests. If the line test results are all greater than zero,
            the pixel is inside the triangle (counterclockwise winding). If the line test results are all less than zero, the pixel is inside
            the triangle (clockwise winding). If any of the line test results equal zero, the pixel is on an edge of the triangle. If a pixel is
            in/on the triangle, I perform a screen bounds check to ensure the pixel's coordinates are valid. If the pixel's coordinates are valid,
            I call fill_pixel(). Note: each pixel is sampled using a 0.5 offset applied to its x and y components. My implementation checks those
            pixels that lie in/on the triangle's bounding box and therefore performs better than a naive implementation that checks every pixel in
            the screen space.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

        <p>
            I had to make several changes to the rasterize_triangle() and resolve_to_framebuffer() functions
            in order to implement supersampling. When sampling with a sample rate of 1, a pixel is
            in/on some triangle or it isn't. When a pixel is in/on a triangle, that pixel is filled with the
            traingle's color. If a pixel is outside a triangle, it remains filled with the background color. When
            supersampling, multiple samples per pixel provides information regarding what portion of the pixel
            lies in/on a triangle. As the sample rate increases so does the information per pixel. This pixel information
            is stored in a sample buffer that is mapped to the frame buffer using the scaling factor
            sqrt(sample_rate). By averaging the colors of all supersamples for a given pixel, we are able to
            construct a more accurate color that better represents the original image or ideal render.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, I updated rasterize_triangle(). I mapped the given triangle into sample space ("higher resolution") using the
            previously mentioned scaling factor. I determined the triangle's scaled bounding box then iterated over it, sampling each
            sub-pixel at its centerpoint. I wrote all sub-pixel color information to the sample buffer. I also needed
            to modify rasterize_point() in order to fill all sub-pixels corresponding to the point with the point's color. Lastly, I modified
            the resolve_to_framebuffer() function in order to correctly map the sample buffer to the frame buffer. I iterated over
            the dimensions of the frame buffer. At each point/pixel in the frame buffer, I iterated over its corresponding
            chunk of sub-pixels in the sample buffer, averaging the sub-pixel's colors to determine the most accurate color for the pixel. These new
            averaged colors are then written to the frame buffer and rasterized.
        </p>

        <p>
            The bug that plagued me the most was dividing my color averages by the wrong value. Initially, I was dividing my averages
            by sqrt(sample_rate) - the scaling factor. This resulted in some strange color behavior. My images would render fine with a
            sample rate of 1 but as soon as I pushed the sample rate higher, the colors of my images would change dramatically. After, rewriting both
            the rasterize_triangle() and resolve_to_framebuffer() functions several times, I finally noticed my bug. Dividing my color averages
            by the sample_rate (number of samples per pixel) instantly fixed the odd color behavior and the unpredictable artifacts I was
            getting as a result of the bug. Always check your values, even the seemingly simple ones!!!
        </p>

        <p>
            Shown below are a series of rasterized images rendered using different sample rates. As you can see, increasing the sample rate
            equates more accurate pixel coloring and therfore reduces jaggies and other rasterization artifacts.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

        <p> A barycentric coordinate system describes a point in reference to some simplex such as 
            a triangle. The barycentric values alpha, beta, and gamma describe the distances from each vertex
            of the triangle to a specified point. For example, the image below depicts a triangle with the colors red, 
            green, and blue set to the triangle's A, B, and C vertices respectively. When rasterizing this triangle, 
            the color at some point within the triangle is determined by scaling the colors assigned to each vertex
            by their respective barycentric values (alpha for vertex A, beta for B, gamma for C) and summing these scaled
            values. This works because alpha, beta, and gamma describe proportional distances - they sum to 1. In simpler 
            terms, if a point is closer to vertex A, its alpha value will be greater and therefore its color will be 
            predominantly red (in this case). </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

        <p> Sampling can be defined as simply evaluating a function at some given point or pixel. In the case of texture mapping, 
            we are given three points in screen/world space and their corresponding texture coordinates. By calculating the barycentric
            values alpha, beta, and gamma we are able to determine wether or not some pixel lies in/on the triangle formed by the given 
            points. Additionally, if a pixel is a part of the given triangle, we can use these barycentric values to determine the texture 
            coordinates of said pixel via linear interpolation. Once we have the interpolated texture coordinates corresponding to our pixel, 
            we need to use this information to obtain a color value from our texture map that most accurately represents our coordinates. In this
            project I implemented two methods for obtaining a color value given some point in texture space - nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation. 
            The nearest neighbor method simply returns the color value associated with the texel nearest our given point. This method is efficient yet 
            does not yield the best results - similar to rasterizing triangles using a sample rate of 1. Bilinear interpolation uses the weighted
            average of the color values of the four nearest texels to produce a new color that is more representative of our given point. The images 
            below highlight the differences between the nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation methods. For textures that possess a lot of high 
            frequency color change, very little fading, the differences between the nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation sampling methods 
            will be more apparent. </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

        <p>Level sampling is the process of determining the best mipmap level to sample for a given point [x, y] in 
           screen space based on the relationship between changes in pixel size in screen space versus texture space. 
           I used the barycentric values corresponding to the points [x, y], [x + 1, y], and [x, y + 1] in order to interpolate 
           three points in texture space: uv00, uv10, and uv01. Subtracting uv00 from uv10 and uv01 gave me the following vectors: 
           [du/dx, dv/dx] and [du/dy, dv/dy]. These two vectors describe the rate of change of the texture coordinates u and v with respect
           to the screen space coordinates x and y. Taking the vector with the greatest magnitude, I took the log of its magnitude
           in order to determine the point's "ideal" mipmap level. Because the result of logging the vector's magnitude is almost always 
           a non-discrete value, I implemented two methods for determining the final mipmap level - "nearest" and linear interpolation. 
           The "nearest" method simply returns the integer level closest to the computed continuous level (ie. 4.3 -> 4). For my second method, 
           I used linear interpolation to construct a new color value based on the weighted sum of two samples from two different mipmap levels 
           (ie. 4.3 -> 0.7 * (sample from level 4) + 0.3 * (sample from level 5)).  
            </p>

        <p>In this project I implemented three fundamental sampling techniques - supersampling, texture mapping via pixel sampling, and texture 
           mapping with mipmaps. Supersampling is a powerful yet costly tool. The higher your sampling rate, the more information gathered per 
           pixel, the larger your sample buffer, the more memory you need to store this information. Additionally, supersampling requires more 
           computations per pixel and is therefore costly in terms of runtime. Despite high memory/time costs, supersampling is really effective 
           at reducing rasterization artifacts such as jaggies. Tuning the sampling rate is a way of "increasing resolution" with a fixed image 
           resolution. The higher your sampling rate, the more accurate the coloring for each pixel.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pixel sampling for texture mapping and mipmap level sampling are both similar in implementation but have different costs in terms 
            of memory usage. Pixel sampling using bilinear interpolation is really good at finding/constructing the best fitting color for some 
            arbitrary point in texture space. Although slightly more inefficient than nearest neighbor sampling, the bilinear approach results in 
            a much more accurate mapping of a texture onto some object/shape and does not strain memory. Mipmaps on the other hand offer further 
            antialiasing benefits but with a higher memory and time cost. Storing each level of a mipmap requires additional memory and the process 
            of determining which mipmap level to sample requires additional computations and is therefore less efficient.
